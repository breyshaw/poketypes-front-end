# PokeTypes! Front-End

My current fun/rep project is an application that will allow a user to quickly and easily pull up type advantages, even in the midst of a Pokemon battle. 

I have played Pokemon for close to 20 years and still cannot memorize all of the type advantages and disadvantages. This is an application being created for anyone else with this issue.

This is a wip and I will update the README as it comes together.
